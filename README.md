``` Background of the problem ```
<p> 
But the word applying job is not easy because you go out there and the money you spent is not enough. Whether the competition is too fierce, you’re unwittingly making a serious mistake or two in your job search in the establishment and company you want to apply, or the lack of callbacks and interviews and abundance of rejection is getting you down, it’s perfectly normal to feel frustrated and defeated while on the lookout for a new job. 

Getting low demand of your job is not capable of your degree or skill because you have no choice to grab that job and to be paid for monthly or weekly you want to work  to survive and paid of, what you have done. Manual Job search is that’s the common problem of this situation. You want to apply but the thing is you’re not capable ir belong their because your skill and degree you hold.

A lot of people  don’t know how to apply for a job that they want and pursue their  goal towards their dream job. And  most of the applicants(who  posted  materials or flyers in the establishment to post a job that they want to find a job seekers) found the whole process a hassle and therefore wasting efforts. And for now on we would like to enhance the tool that is used. We would like to promote the app system which is called CDO HIRING APP that will provide less stress and less efforts in the job search, making it  easy and you don’t want to go, in the establishment and anywhere else.

<h1> Problem Statement </h1>
<p>This proposal will address these specific problems: </p>

<h2>Time oconsuming for the applicant</h2>
<p> 
When it comes to applying for jobs, quantity is not always the best policy. In fact, if you apply to jobs that you’re clearly unqualified for, or that you wouldn’t actually want if you received an offer, you can consider the time spent on the application wasted.
</p>

<h2>Insignificant Job for the job seekers</h2>
<p> 
When it comes to applying a job in the establishment there are too small information about job, but you have no choice but grab it and work for it to get your experience but, you didn’t belong for that job that suits you. 
</p>

<h2>Low salary</h2>
<p> 
The job that you apply for is not suitable for you, therefore the salary that is given to you is not enough for your hard work and skill because you didn’t belong to their job qualification.
</p>

<h2>Attract and Engage Top Talent</h2>
<p> 
The job of hiring a manager is to find and connect with the talent that has the requisite skill-set for the offered role. However, managers must communicate succinctly to attract the right kind of candidates. A well-crafted job description communicating the number of open positions, job responsibilities, qualifications, and experience required are what attract the candidates.

<h2>Improve the Quality of Hires</h2>

Improving the quality of hire metric is one of the most crucial objectives of recruitment and selection. Pre-selection helps to condense the received applications to the most suitable options.

Fitting in a company is essential for the growth of an individual as well as an organization as employees must align with the broader organizational vision. Therefore, talent experts must zero in on candidates that will adhere to the company’s work culture. This can be achieved by using personality assessments and other such tools to identify people who are most likely to fit well in your workplace’s culture and environment.

<h2>Construction Site Skilled Worker</h2>
<p> 
The Skilled Laborer’s applicants include ensuring worksites are clean and safe, erecting scaffolding, spreading gravel, using drills, jackhammers, and other power tools, and providing assistance with heavy machinery. You should also be able to take instruction from superiors and complete on-the-job training.

<h1>Methodology</h1>
<p> 
The type of methodology that the proponents intended to use is the waterfall model. Waterfall model is a breakdown of project activities into linear sequential phases, where each phase depends on the deliverables of the previous one and corresponds to a specialization of tasks. It is a cascade SDLC model, in which development process looks like the flow, moving step by step through the phases of Requirement Analysis, System Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment and Maintenance which the proponents used working on the project and those were the following.
